Welcome to my little corner on the web. Here, you will find some of my software projects 
and tutorials.

## [Fusion OS](osdev/01-intro.md)

This is both a documentation of my journey and a tutorial for building a modern x64
operating system from scratch in Nim. You can find the source code on GitHub:
[https://github.com/khaledh/fusion](https://github.com/khaledh/fusion)

## [NimJet](nimjet/01-intro.md)

NimJet is a plugin for the JetBrains IDEs that provides support for the [Nim 
programming language](https://nim-lang.org/). It is currently in development and is 
not yet available in the JetBrains plugin marketplace.
